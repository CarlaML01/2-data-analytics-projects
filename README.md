### This two reports are submitted as part of my nanodegree program[](https://viewe617827b.udacity-student-workspaces.com/notebooks/Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb#This-report-is-submitted-as-partial-fulfillment-of-the-requirements-of-the-1st-project-of-the-nanodegree)
# Project 01 - Weather trends: 
<a id='intro'></a>
## Introduction

This is the meteorological data set for data analysis. This project requires the following steps:

-	Extract data from a database using a SQL query
-	Calculate a moving average in a spreadsheet
-	Create a line chart in a spreadsheet

The two datasets used: [city_level](https://github.com/CarlaML01/projects/blob/9dab448f732541bbfa0b1ed88b9ff3ca0d7e22ca/city_level.csv) and [global_temperature](https://github.com/CarlaML01/projects/blob/main/global_temp.csv)

## Goal
My goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live.

## Conclusions
Further details of the dataset, cleaning and exploration of the data can be seen in the [PDF_file](https://github.com/CarlaML01/projects/blob/9dab448f732541bbfa0b1ed88b9ff3ca0d7e22ca/Project%2001_CARLAML.pdf)

- Five years moving average temperatures shows that Budapest, Hungary, has higher average temperature than the global temperatures.
- The overall difference of temperature between Budapest and Global is 1.407030769 Â°C.
- To be able to compare them, a t-test was performed, and was able to confirm they are different from each other but indicate variables which can be considered moderately correlated (See table below).
- Budapest and Global temperature levels are both increasing with time.
- The global temperature has lower variance than Budapest temperature changes.

# Project TMDb movie dataset: 
<a id='intro'></a>
## Introduction

This is the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

#### Here is the [link](https://github.com/CarlaML01/projects/blob/9dab448f732541bbfa0b1ed88b9ff3ca0d7e22ca/tmdb-movies.csv) for the dataset.

This database contains the following variables:

- id - A unique identifier for each movie.
- imdb_id - A unique identifier for each movie on IMDB.
- cast - The name of lead and supporting actors.
- director - the director of the movie
- budget - The budget in which the movie was made.
- genres - The genre of the movie, Action, Comedy ,Thriller, etc.
- homepage - A link to the homepage of the movie.
- keywords - The keywords or tags related to the movie.
- original_title - The title of the movie before translation or adaptation.
- overview - A brief description of the movie.
- popularity - Quantification of the movie popularity.
- production_companies - The production company name of the movie.
- release_date - The date on which it was released.
- release_year - Year when the movie was released.
- revenue - The worldwide revenue generated by the movie.
- runtime - The running time of the movie in minutes.
- tagline - Movie's tagline.
- vote_count - count of the ratings the movie recieved.
- vote_avg - avg. ratings the movie recieved.
- budget_adj - shows the budget associated movie in terms of 2010 in dollars.
- revenue_adj - shows the revenue associated movie in terms of 2010 in dollars.

Contain:

<p>Total Rows = 10866<br>
Total Columns = 21 <p>

### After cleaning and exploration those are my findings and conclusions:
<a id='conclusions'></a>
## Conclusions

**Question 1**: Who are the most famous actors?
- The most famous actor is Robert de Nirto with 52 original movies.
  
**Question 2**: Which Movie Has The Highest profit?
- The movie Avatar showed to have the highest profit. Followed by Star Wars and Titanic.

**Question 3** What are the most popular genres over time? Have audience preferences changed?
- Drama is the most popular genre, following by action, comedy and thriller.
- There's changes of the most popular genre accordint to the year, and audience preference has changed as well.
> Limitations : The data in the columns of (Directors, genres, production_companies) are sperated by '|', so I needed a function which took any column as argument from which data is needed to be extracted and keep track of count taking a given column, and separate the string by '|' .

**Question 4** What are the relation between the Revenue, Popularity, and Rating?
- The Revenue increases with increase in Popularity,That makes Revenue and Popularity are directly proportional. We also visualize the left-skewed normal distributions for relationship between Revenue Vs Rating and Popularity Vs Rating.
 > Limitations : Firstly there were many rows within the dataframe which contained a certain amount of null values. So, first I had to DORP those rows. Furthermore, the data also contained a duplicated value row, which had to be removed, following a re-check of null values for our key parameters.
